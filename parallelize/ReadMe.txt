# ReadMe for the "parallelize" folder
0. Both "spline_src_morecompartment.R" and "fit_mcm_Rpt2_morecompart.R" require "fit_function_fumi.R", which is the same as "MCM_functions_copy.r" provided (so, change the file name to run the scripts in this folder).
I. Parallelizing the equivalent of "spline_start_morecompart_demo.R".
"spline_start_morecompartment.R" was run from "spline_src_morecompart#.sh" (# is an index for each parallel procedure; as each parallelized procedure was run for 100 genes, # was from 1 to 31 to cover 3039 genes). Three arguments for "spline_start_morecompartment.R" were encoded in "spine_src_morecompart#.sh": the starting gene index, the ending gene index, and the output file name. In "spline_src_morecompart1.sh", the starting gene index = 1, the ending gene index = 101, and the output file name = "log_normal_morecompart1.Rdata". Thus, "log_normal_morecompart#.Rdata" was the equivalent for the specified gene set of the 2-gene example, "MCM.fit.continous.demo.RData"

2. Parallelizing the equivalent of "fit_mcm_Rpt2_morecompart_demo.R".
"fit_mcm_Rpt2_morecompart.R" was run from "fitting_src_morecompart#.sh".  Four arguments for "fit_mcm_Rpt2_morecompart.R" were encoded in "fitting_src_morecomaprt#.sh": the starting gene index, the ending gene index, the file name for the output from the corresponding "spline_src_morecompart#.sh" (named as "log_normal_morecompart#.Rdata"), and the output file name. In "fitting_src_morecompart1.sh", the starting gene index = 1, the ending gene index = 101, the file name for the output from the corresponding "spline_src_morecmpart#.sh" = "log_normal_morecmopart1.Rdata", and the output file name = "fitting_morecompar1.Rdata". Thus, "fitting_morecompart#.Rdata" was the equivalent for the specified gene set of the 2-gene example, "MCM.fit.read.count.demo.RData".
