# MCM_At_AvrRpt2_time_course
This is a collection of R scripts and data files used in the manuscript, "Dynamic decomposition of transcriptome responses during plant effector-triggered immunity revealed conserved responses in two distinct cell populations", https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.05.10.540266.

"R.script.descriptions.xlsx" describes all R scripts under its "R scripts" tab, the fundamental data sets under its "data sets from other works" tab, and .RData files generated by these R scripts from the fundamental data sets under its "generated .Rdata files" tab.

For MCM fitting, only R scripts for two-gene demo versions are given here to demonstrate how MCM was fit to the data for each gene. With high precision calculation, MCM fitting would take long time for 3039 significantly upregulated genes. Thus, in reality we parallelized the procedure. Some of actual R and shell scripts used for parallelized MCM fitting are included in the folder "parallelization".

This repository has a subfolder, "data", which is required to run the R scripts. This data subfolder has the fundamental data sets and has already been populated with the .RData generated by the scripts. 

Under the "data" subfolder, subsubfolders, "figures" and "model.results.for.each.gene.class", are required for outputs from R scripts, and they have already been populated with the output files. The "GO.analysis.peak.level.ratio.230609" subsubfolder contains .csv files, which are the results of GO term enrichment analysis by Panther. Also, for the figure file outputs, a subfolder, "figures", is required in the "data" subfolder. The "figures" subfolder has been prepopulated with the figure and table files. The last part of "Fig6_Table1_TableS_r3.r" imports these .csv files and summerize the GO term enrichment analysis results.
